Zach's mod for CC

Thanks to the Metal Slug guy for that awesome parachute and .lua
Also Whitty.

Whermacht: The primary military force for the Nazi Party, including the
Heer (Army), the Kriegsmarine (Navy), and Luftwaffe (Airforce). The
Wehrmacht used some of the best vehicles and planes in WWII, for example:

THE KING TIGER! (Panzerkampfwagon VI - B)
THE KETTENKKRAD (SdKfz II)

The Waffen Schutzstaffel (Waffen SS) was not included as Adolf Hitler
wanted it as a paramilitary force under the command of Henrich Himmler,
the Nazi "Second in command" of sorts.


Notes:
0 = NOANIM
1 = ALWAYSLOOP
2 = ALWAYSRANDOM
3 = ALWAYSPINGPONG 
4 = LOOPWHENMOVING
5 = LOOPWHENOPENCLOSE
6 = PINGPONGOPENCLOSE

My Tut for CC, made for apprentice Will Sparrow, and whoever else wants it
Any mistakes, I apologise. Never will be finidhed :(
GET DOWN AND PRAY, WILL!

Tabs are essential, and should be laid out in the following order:

Subject				     = The object / actor created.
	-Values			     = The he properties and values.
		-Value Properties    = Add one tab for each new subject.
					  Anything here will affect the 
					  latest 'Value'. This new tab
					  makes the latest value the
					  subject.


[Example]

AddDevice = HDFirearm
	SpriteFile = ContentFile
		FilePath = Example.rte/Example.bmp

[Note: This is not usually the order that values will appear.]
Tabs need to be in the right order else the game will crash, and they
keep your code nice and organised. You'll get used to tapping the 'TAB'
key.


//Comments
//Double forward slash represents a comment. The game does not read
//comments.


/*
Forward slash - aterisk excludes
everything inside the slashes and asterisks, counting it as a comment. This
is useful for preserving an unworking peice of code to fix later on if you
are eager to play the game.
Asterisk - forward slash ends comment.
*/


All values and subjects when typed should have no spaces, and each
word should start with a capital letter (EXEPT NAMES!)
For each value and property, a '=' and two spaces will be used inbetween
the property and value.

[Example]

Example = Example
	Something = Whatever
	Something[Space][Equals][Space]Whatever

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Names:
There are three types of names in CC.
They are:

PresetName = A name recorded by the game to be used later on.
This is the most used name in CC.

InstanceName = A name that will not be recorded, and cannot called
apon ater in the game.

CopyOf = CopyOfs call upon preset names, and apply all the
copied subject's values to the instance subject. CopyOfs will be followed
by a preset or instance name.

CopyOfs can then change the original's values by order of tabbing. You can
add and change values, but not take them away. See, if you want the CopyOf
to not have a value that the original has, you cannot change it, and the
only way to get around this is to write the coding [again].

[Example]

AddEffect = MOPixel
	CopyOf = Grenade Fragment Yellow
	PresetName = Lolz I iS no GrAmmarz!

[Example]

AddEffect = MOPixel
	CopyOf = Grenade Fragment Yellow
	PresetName = Lolz DiE G/F yEllowZ!
	Mass = 100000	//OMG 1337 h@x
	LifeTime = 100
	Sharpness = 3.5
	//etc

Say, for example, I want to attach shoulder plates and shin guards to an
actor, one for each two arms an legs. They each have the same properties,
exept for the SpriteFile. I only have to code one, and copy the others.

[Example]

AddEffect = Attachable
	PresetName = Guard A
	Mass = 10
	Sharpness = 1
	HitsMOs = 0
	GetsHitByMOs = 1
	SpriteFile = ContentFile
		FilePath = [Whatever]
	//etc

AddEffect = Attachable
	CopyOf = GuardA
	PresetName = GuardB
	SpriteFile = ContentFile
		FilePath = [Whatever 2]

AddEffect = Attachable
	CopyOf = GuardA
	PresetName = GuardC
	SpriteFile = ContentFile
		FilePath = [Whatever 3]

AddEffect = Attachable
	CopyOf = GuardA
	PresetName = GuardD
	SpriteFile = ContentFile
		FilePath = [Whatever 4]

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Sprites: Are pictures attached to subjects using the code:

SpriteFile = ContentFile
	FilePath = Whatever.rte/Stuff.bmp	//Notice the tabbing, the
						sprie becomes the subject
						and has it's own column.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Moving on:

To create a subject, we use the word 'Add' in the first tabbing column.

[Example]

AddActor = AHuman
AddDevice = HDFirearm
AddEffect = MOPixel

We can also use 'Add' to add subjects to other subjects, example, a chest
plate to a heavy soldier

[Example]

AddActor = AHuman		//We call the subject the 'Parent'
	"
	"
	AddAttachable = Attachable	//And the attached items the
		CopyOf = Soldier Heavy Chest Plate A  //'Children' objects

The 'Add' line will usually be followed by the name, and other values
depending on the subject.

MOs

There are three types of MOs

MOPixels = one-pixel pixels that have no sprites.
MOSParticles = All I know is that these have sprites, can have emitters
[later], entry and exit wounds, and
